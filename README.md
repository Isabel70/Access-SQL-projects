###Run own business of musical instruments


The business we created the database for is a Music Instruments store. Initially we wanted to create a database for “Accent Music” which is a famous music instruments store in Delaware but after contacting them through email I found out that they already have a well-developed database, so instead we decided to create our own business based on “Accent Music”.
The name of our business is Musika, it’s a merchandising business that sells musical instruments. Since we externally procure our inventory, the business deals with two sets of ext
ernal parties; the vendors and customers.  The business has multiple vendors, each supplying us a different line of products.  Our inventory consists of the following categories:
1.      Bass Instruments
2.      String Instruments
3.      Woodwinds
4.      Keyboards
