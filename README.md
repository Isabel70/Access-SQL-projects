Run own business of musical instruments


The business we created the database for is a Music Instruments store.
The name of our business is Musiku, itâ€™s a merchandising business that sells musical instruments. Since we externally procure our inventory, the business deals with two sets of ext
ernal parties; the vendors and customers.  The business has multiple vendors, each supplying us a different line of products.  Our inventory consists of the following categories:
1.      Bass Instruments
2.      String Instruments
3.      Woodwinds
4.      Keyboards
